# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

1. Built as a learning aid to help students fully conceptualize Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
2. Designed to support understanding of data structures and algorithms.
3. Includes a fully functional graph designer tool.
4. Provides step-by-step algorithm animation.
5. Visually displays the state of the graph after each step.
6. Shows the state of the priority queue throughout the traversal.
Thank You!!
